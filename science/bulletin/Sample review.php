          <br />
         The “film in film” phenomenon, well-known in practice and theoretically meant over, has given birth to a remarkable modification over the last years: “film as an unfinished script”, with the plot being the process of making the film. This modification becomes the subject matter of the present article.

         Example: 
          <br />
         Contemporary cinema demonstrates a significant compositional complexity. Sometimes, bizarre and intricate forms emerge. It is necessary to search for an adequate approach to analyzing them. V.V. Korshunov made an this attempt which determines the actuality of the article.

          <br />

          <br />
         The author proves the singularity of the “Film as film” formula underlying two aspects: culturological (the problem of reality) and dramaturgic (the problem of composition). The filmogrpahy is selected very carefully. The author dwells upon 5 recent films of American, West European and Russian production made: Adaptation by Spike Jonze ( 2002), Film about Film by V. Rubinchik (2002), Reconstruction by Christoffer Boe (2003), Ober by Alex by A. van Warmerdam (2006) and Stranger than Fiction by Mark Forster (2006).
